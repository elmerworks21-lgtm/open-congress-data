# Neo4j Database Schema Documentation

This document describes the structure of the Neo4j graph database that stores Philippine Congress data. The database is populated by the `scripts/sync_to_neo4j.py` script from TOML files in the `data/` directory.

## Overview

The database uses a graph model to represent the relationships between Congress sessions, chambers (Senate/House), committees, and people (senators and representatives). This structure allows for efficient querying of complex relationships like chamber memberships across different congresses and tracking of political careers over time.

## Node Types

**Direction:**
- `(Group)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(Congress)` for chambers
- `(Committee)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(Congress)` for committees

**Properties:** None

**Example Cypher Query:**
```cypher
// Find Senate chamber for 20th Congress
MATCH (g:Group {type: "chamber", subtype: "senate"})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Congress {congress_number: 20})
RETURN g, c

// Find all committees in 20th Congress
MATCH (com:Committee)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(con:Congress {congress_number: 20})
RETURN com.name, con.name
```

### 3. AUTHORED

Connects people to the documents they authored.

**Direction:** `(Person)-[:AUTHORED]->(Document)`

**Properties:** None

**Example Cypher Query:**
```cypher
// Find all bills authored by a specific person
MATCH (p:Person {last_name: "Marcos"})-[:AUTHORED]->(d:Document)

RETURN p.last_name, p.first_name
```

### 4. FILED_IN

Connects documents to the congress they were filed in.

**Direction:** `(Document)-[:FILED_IN]->(Congress)`

**Properties:** None

**Example Cypher Query:**
```cypher
// Find all bills filed in 19th Congress
MATCH (d:Document)-[:FILED_IN]->(c:Congress {congress_number: 19})
RETURN d.bill_number, d.title, d.subtype
ORDER BY d.bill_number

// Count bills by congress
MATCH (d:Document)-[:FILED_IN]->(c:Congress)
RETURN c.ordinal, COUNT(d) as bill_count
ORDER BY c.congress_number
```

## Relationship Hierarchy

The database follows this hierarchy:
```
Congress
    ↑
    | (BELONGS_TO)
    |
  Group (Chamber)
    ↑
    | (MEMBER_OF)
    |
  Person
    |
    | (AUTHORED)
    ↓
  Document
    |
    | (FILED_IN)
    ↓
  Congress

Congress
    ↑
    | (BELONGS_TO)
    |
  Committee
```

**Important:**
- There are NO direct relationships from Person to Congress. All person-congress connections go through the chamber (Group) nodes.
- Documents are connected to Congress via FILED_IN relationships
- Documents are connected to their authors (Person nodes) via AUTHORED relationships

## Indexes

The following indexes are created for optimized query performance:

1. **Congress Indexes:**
   - `(Congress).id`
   - `(Congress).congress_number`

2. **Group Indexes:**
   - `(Group).id`
   - `(Group).type`
   - `(Group).congress`

3. **Committee Indexes:**
   - `(Committee).id`
   - `(Committee).name`

4. **Person Indexes:**
   - `(Person).id`
   - `(Person).full_name`
   - `(Person).last_name`

5. **Document Indexes:**
   - `(Document).id`
   - `(Document).name`
   - `(Document).congress`
   - `(Document).bill_number`

## Common Query Patterns

### Find all senators in a specific congress
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(g:Group {type: "chamber", subtype: "senate", congress: 20})
RETURN p.last_name, p.first_name
ORDER BY p.last_name
```

### Find which chamber a person served in for each congress
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person {last_name: "Aquino"})-[:MEMBER_OF]->(g:Group)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Congress)
RETURN p.first_name, p.last_name, g.subtype as chamber, c.ordinal
ORDER BY c.congress_number
```

### Count senators vs representatives by congress
```cypher
MATCH (g:Group {type: "chamber"})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Congress)
MATCH (p:Person)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(g)
RETURN c.ordinal, g.subtype as chamber, COUNT(DISTINCT p) as member_count
ORDER BY c.congress_number, g.subtype
```

### Find committees a person might be associated with in a congress
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person {last_name: "Angara"})-[:MEMBER_OF]->(g:Group)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Congress)
MATCH (com:Committee)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c)
RETURN DISTINCT com.name, c.ordinal
```

### Search for person by senate website key
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE "ABENI" IN p.senate_website_keys
RETURN p
```

### Find all congresses a person served in
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person {last_name: "Aquino", first_name: "Benigno"})-[:MEMBER_OF]->(g:Group)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Congress)
RETURN c.ordinal, g.subtype as chamber
ORDER BY c.congress_number
```

### Get complete chamber membership for a congress
```cypher
// Get all Senate members for 20th Congress
MATCH (c:Congress {congress_number: 20})<-[:BELONGS_TO]-(g:Group {type: "chamber", subtype: "senate"})<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(p:Person)
RETURN p.last_name, p.first_name
ORDER BY p.last_name

// Get all House members for 20th Congress
MATCH (c:Congress {congress_number: 20})<-[:BELONGS_TO]-(g:Group {type: "chamber", subtype: "house"})<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(p:Person)
RETURN p.last_name, p.first_name
ORDER BY p.last_name
```

### Find bills authored by senators in a specific congress
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(g:Group {type: "chamber", subtype: "senate", congress: 19})
MATCH (p)-[:AUTHORED]->(d:Document)-[:FILED_IN]->(c:Congress {congress_number: 19})
RETURN p.last_name, p.first_name, d.bill_number, d.title
ORDER BY p.last_name, d.bill_number
```

### Get bill authorship statistics
```cypher
// Count bills per author in 19th Congress
MATCH (p:Person)-[:AUTHORED]->(d:Document)-[:FILED_IN]->(c:Congress {congress_number: 19})
RETURN p.last_name, p.first_name, COUNT(d) as bills_authored
ORDER BY bills_authored DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Find co-authored bills
```cypher
// Find bills with multiple authors
MATCH (d:Document)<-[:AUTHORED]-(p:Person)
WITH d, COLLECT(p) as authors
WHERE SIZE(authors) > 1
RETURN d.bill_number, d.title, [a IN authors | a.last_name + ", " + a.first_name] as author_names
ORDER BY d.bill_number
```

## Data Import Process

The database is populated by `scripts/sync_to_neo4j.py` which:

1. Reads TOML files from:
   - `data/congress/*.toml` - Congress entities
   - `data/group/chamber/*.toml` - Chamber (Senate/House) entities
   - `data/committee/*.toml` - Committee entities
   - `data/person/*.toml` - Person entities
   - `data/person/.senate-website-key-mapping.yml` - Mapping of Senate website keys to person IDs
   - `data/document/hb/[congress]/*.toml` - House Bill documents
   - `data/document/sb/[congress]/*.toml` - Senate Bill documents

2. Creates nodes with MERGE operations (create if not exists, update if exists) using batch operations for performance

3. Establishes relationships based on:
   - Chamber TOML files contain `congress` field → creates BELONGS_TO relationships to Congress
   - Committee TOML files contain `congresses` array → creates BELONGS_TO relationships to Congress
   - Person TOML files contain `memberships` array with chamber details → creates MEMBER_OF relationships to appropriate Group nodes
   - Document TOML files contain:
     - `meta.congress` → creates FILED_IN relationships to Congress
     - `meta.senate_website_author_codes` → creates AUTHORED relationships from Person nodes (using the mapping file)

4. Creates indexes for optimized querying

### Performance Optimizations

The sync script uses several optimizations for faster data import:
- **Batch operations**: Processes multiple nodes in single transactions using UNWIND
- **Reduced network round trips**: Groups related operations together
- **Progress tracking**: Shows ETA and processing rate for large datasets
- **Configurable batch sizes**: Adjustable batch sizes for different entity types
- **Fast mode for CI/CD**:
  - 1000-document batches (vs 500 in normal mode)
  - Sequential loading with progress tracking to avoid hangs
  - Optimized for complete database rebuilds
  - Reduces sync time significantly through larger batch sizes

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Normal sync (update existing data)
python scripts/sync_to_neo4j.py

# Clear database first (will prompt for confirmation)
python scripts/sync_to_neo4j.py --clear

# Clear database without confirmation (for CI/CD)
python scripts/sync_to_neo4j.py --clear --yes

# Fast mode with larger batches (optimized for CI/CD)
python scripts/sync_to_neo4j.py --fast

# Full CI/CD mode (clear + fast) - recommended for production deployments
python scripts/sync_to_neo4j.py --clear --yes --fast
```

## Membership Structure in Person TOML Files

Person files contain a `memberships` array that defines their chamber affiliations:

```toml
[[memberships]]
type = "chamber"
congress = 15
subtype = "house"  # or "senate"

[[memberships]]
type = "chamber"
congress = 16
subtype = "senate"
```

This structure creates MEMBER_OF relationships to the corresponding chamber Group nodes.

## Connection Configuration

The sync script requires the following environment variables:

```env
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## REST API Usage

External REST APIs can query this database using the Neo4j driver for their respective language. The graph structure allows for:

- Efficient traversal of relationships
- Complex filtering across multiple entity types
- Aggregation queries for statistics
- Full-text search on indexed properties
- Clear separation between chambers (Senate/House)

## Notes for API Development

1. **Array Properties:** Properties like `senate_website_keys` and `aliases` are stored as arrays. Use the `IN` operator to search within them.

2. **Optional Properties:** Not all properties are present on all nodes. Always handle potential null values in your queries.

3. **Chamber Navigation:** To find which congress a person served in, you must traverse through the Group (chamber) node:
   - Person → MEMBER_OF → Group → BELONGS_TO → Congress

4. **Performance:** Use indexed properties in WHERE clauses when possible for optimal query performance.

5. **Data Consistency:** The MERGE operations ensure no duplicate nodes are created based on the `id` property.

6. **Chamber Types:** Always filter Group nodes by `type: "chamber"` when looking for Senate/House chambers, as the Group label may be used for other entity types in the future.
